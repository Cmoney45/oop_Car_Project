# oop_Car_Project

You are being asked by a custom car modifying shop to build a system where they can modify vehicles by changing tires, fenders, hood, color, etc. All this is possible by creating different types of vehicle objects which can be customized by selecting the options that the customer wantâ€™s. The vehicle object will calculate the price for the whole configured vehicle.  A vehicle is made of many parts, and it is vital that you design each part as a class. The following parts in the picture below are some of the items that the custom shop customizes on a given vehicle for their customers.  However, you are being requested to only create the Vehicle object with the following listed parts (Hood, Fender, Doors, and Wheelset). The second phase of the project will deal with completing other configurable parts of the vehicle (out of scope for this project).
